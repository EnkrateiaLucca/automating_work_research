The "anxiety lump" in our chest during stressful experiences is caused by muscular tension in the glottis and activation of the vagus nerve, which increases heart rate, stops digestion, and produces adrenaline and cortisol. Factors that can contribute to the development of an anxiety lump include stress, anxiety, protective mechanisms in the body, biological predispositions, and environmental stressors. Emotional pain is often triggered by an emotional or traumatic event, and the goal is to figure out the cause of the lump and how to get rid of it.
