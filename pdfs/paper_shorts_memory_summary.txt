A study conducted by researchers at LMU Munich investigated the impact of short-form social media videos on cognitive function, specifically prospective memory (remembering previously planned actions). The study found that engaging with TikTok while performing a prospective memory task had a significant detrimental effect on performance compared to other social media platforms or no activity. The study suggests that the combination of short videos and rapid context-switching impairs intention recall and execution, with potential consequences for media technology designers to prevent harm to users' memory and wellbeing.
This paper investigates how social media feed interruptions impact prospective memory (PM) and presents a between-subjects study where participants engage in different social media activities during a break between sessions of a lexical decision (LD) task and a PM task. The study finds that TikTok has the most detrimental effect on PM compared to Twitter and YouTube or resting. The paper discusses the importance of understanding the negative impact of highly engaging and rapidly changing contexts on PM and productivity, and also provides an overview of the PM functioning, the impact of interruptions, and social media distraction on PM.
This study investigates the impact of interruptions caused by social media apps on executing previously planned intentions in a dual-task setting. The study used a lab experiment with four interruption conditions: rest, Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok. The research found that short-form videos, as found in TikTok and YouTube, impair our capacity to retain intentions due to their fast pace of switching between topics and emotional content. The study highlights the need for further research on the relationship between new forms of social media content and executive functioning. Participants were randomly assigned to a condition containing a platform they use frequently in their daily life. The study used both lexical decision and prospective memory tasks simultaneously to monitor prospective memory processes.
The study involved a lexical decision task (LD) and a prospective memory task (PM) in which participants were required to press specific buttons in occurrence of a PM cue word. Participants completed two rounds of the LD and PM tasks with a 10 minute interruption in the middle, which varied according to their experimental condition (rest, twitter, youtube, or tiktok). The study measured behavioral data and collected responses to both a beginning and ending survey, which included questions about social media platform usage and overall screen time. The study found that the type of interruption significantly affected task performance, with tiktok leading to the most interference.
The study examined the impact of social media apps, including Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok, on the ability to retain intentions. Participants were assigned to one of four conditions based on their usage of these apps and underwent a training phase before performing tasks. The study measured behavioral performance, including accuracy and reaction time, and analyzed standard scales for social media addiction and absent-minded phone use. The study used a drift-diffusion model to analyze reaction time distribution for correct and error responses and found that short-form videos on social media apps degraded the capacity to retain intentions.
The summarized article is a report of a study conducted on participants' reaction time and accuracy during interruption conditions in lexical decision (LD) and prospective memory (PM) tasks. The interruptions were in the form of social media apps, such as TikTok, Twitter, and YouTube, and were compared to a rest condition. The study found a significant increase in errors in the TikTok post-interruption PM trials, while accuracy remained robust in the LD task. The article also describes the statistical analysis used to predict accuracy in interruption conditions and the results of individual interruption conditions on task accuracy.
The study investigated the effects of interruptions during tasks, specifically comparing different interruption conditions (TikTok, Twitter, YouTube) on participants' response accuracy and decision behavior using lexical decision and prospective memory tasks. Results showed that interruptions had a significant effect on the prospective memory task in the TikTok interruption condition, leading to a reduction in decision bound and an increase in non-decision time and variance. However, there was no significant effect on the lexical decision task. Subjective results also showed no significant difference in reported engagement, but there was a significant difference in perceived task difficulty between different interruption conditions. The study used bayes factors to supplement classical statistical inference and establish equivalence of interruptions on some dependent variables. Overall, the study suggests that short-form videos, such as TikTok, may degrade our capacity to retain intentions.
The article reports the results of a study that examined the impact of different social media feed modalities on prospective memory (PM) performance and reaction times (RTs). The results showed significant differences in the drift rate, variance, and decision bound in the PM task but no significance in the LD task. In terms of interruption, there was a significant difference in variance and non-decision time in the PM task but no significance in the LD task. However, engagement and reported values of SUQ-A and BSMARS did not show significant differences across different interruption conditions. The study provides insights into how different social media feed designs impact cognitive performance and suggests implications for media technology designers. Further research in this area is needed.
A study presented at a conference in 2023 showed that short-form videos, like those found on TikTok, can negatively impact our ability to retain intentions. Participants who were interrupted by TikTok videos during a task had a lower accuracy in their responses, and their ability to detect cues for intention execution also decreased. The study suggests that the attentional demands of these videos may make it difficult for people to keep their intentions active in their minds. Further research is needed to better understand this effect and its implications for technology design.
The study shows that interruptions caused by short-form videos, such as TikTok, significantly impair prospective memory performance, and participants are vulnerable to interruptions and not ready to resume the task. The interruptions absorb resources that would otherwise be allocated to the primary task, resulting in decreased attention and processing efficiency. The study suggests two major consequences for media technology designers: mitigating the adverse effects of short-form videos on prospective memory and intentionally exploiting the associated prospective memory degradation. To mitigate the adverse effects, social media designers can use digital reminders or proactive reminder systems, while ensuring that users maintain agency and use social media feeds according to their needs and values. To intentionally leverage the impact of short-form videos, game designers can strategically insert short cutscenes to increase immersion or difficulty.
This study found that short-form videos, such as those commonly found on TikTok, can negatively affect our ability to remember to perform tasks (prospective memory), while other social media platforms such as Twitter and YouTube do not have the same impact. The study suggests that short-form videos could be used therapeutically to distract people from unhappy memories, or to help users transfer their focus to a new task, but more research is needed in these areas. The study also highlights certain limitations and suggests future research directions. The dataset and analysis scripts are available for others to reproduce and extend the results.

The study examines the impact of short-form videos, such as those found on social media platforms like Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts, on prospective memory, the ability to remember and complete intended actions. The study draws on a range of research on prospective memory, interruptions, and digital distractions to argue that these types of videos could lead to a degraded capacity to retain intentions. The article provides a comprehensive literature review of related studies and highlights the importance of designing interventions and software to mitigate the negative effects of digital distractions.
