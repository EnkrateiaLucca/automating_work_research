The paper discusses the trend of attention in neural sequence processing models and how it has become the key building block for such models. Attention weights are commonly used to interpret a model's decision-making process and gain an insight into its internal workings. However, this paper highlights a key issue with using attention weights to make explanations, as it becomes unreliable across layers of the transformer model. The paper proposes two methods for approximating the attention to input tokens. The methods include attention rollout and attention flow, useful in quantifying the flow of information through self-attention. These methods provide better diagnostic tools for visualization and debugging of the model.
The article discusses an analysis on the usefulness of attention weights in a transformer encoder for predicting singularity or plurality of verbs in sentences. The authors use the subject-verb agreement dataset and train a transformer model with 6 layers and 8 heads. They investigate three types of attention weights: raw attention, embedding attentions, and attention flow. They use the input ablation method to estimate an importance score for each input token and compute the correlation between the attention weights and the importance scores. The authors found that attention flow and attention rollout are more useful than raw attention weights for predicting verb numbers.
This text discusses methods for analyzing attention mechanisms in transformer models. Specifically, they introduce attention rollout and attention flow to track information propagation from input to embeddings in higher layers. They also explain how residual connections and position-wise feed-forward networks affect attention weights. Attention rollout involves computing attention weights between positions in different layers, while attention flow treats the attention graph as a flow network to approximate attention to input nodes. The authors also mention accounting for the mixing of information between heads in transformer blocks.
The article discusses two methods, attention rollout and attention flow, for analyzing attention in neural network models. Attention is a mechanism in NLP models that determines the importance of certain tokens in the input. The two methods can be computed in polynomial time, and both are better correlated with blank-out scores and input gradients compared to raw attention. The article provides examples of attention maps for correctly and incorrectly classified inputs and compares the performance of the two methods with raw attention. The article concludes that attention can be analyzed using these methods to better understand the behavior of NLP models.
This piece discusses the use of attention weights and their reliability compared to weights in natural language processing models. Attention flow and attention rollout are two methods used in this paper, with attention rollout being stricter and providing more focused attention patterns, although not necessarily resulting in more accurate results than attention flow. The paper also provides examples of how these methods can be applied to different tasks and models. However, the authors caution over-interpreting the results as the approximations made in using attention weights can oversimplify the internal workings of models. Further research is suggested to adjust attention weights and attribution methods.

The first article titled "Huggingface's Transformers: State-of-the-Art Natural Language Processing" was written in 2019 by a group of authors including Thomas Wolf, Lysandre Debut, Victor Sanh, and others. It discusses the advancements of natural language processing using the Transformers technology. The second article titled "Show, Attend and Tell: Neural Image Caption Generation with Visual Attention" was written in 2015 by a group of authors including Yoshua Bengio and Ruslan Salakhudinov. It discusses the technology of caption generation for images using visual attention.
The appendix discusses analyzing attention weights in a multi-head setup. It explains that we can analyze attention heads separately or average all heads to have a single attention graph, but we should be careful as treating attention heads separately may not be accurate due to information mixing between the heads. The appendix suggests analyzing the role of each head in isolation using attention rollout and attention flow. To avoid assuming no mixing of information, the "input attention" is computed by treating all layers below as single head layers. The appendix provides an example for computing attention rollout for headkat layer ias~a(i; k) =a(i; k)a(i), where,a(i)is attention rollout computed for layer iwith the single head assumption.
