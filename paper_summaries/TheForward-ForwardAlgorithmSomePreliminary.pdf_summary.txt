The paper introduces a new learning procedure called the forward-forward algorithm for neural networks. It replaces the forward and backward passes of backpropagation with two forward passes, one with positive data and one with negative data. The aim is to have high goodness for positive data and low goodness for negative data in each layer. The paper also discusses the shortcomings of backpropagation as a model of how cortex learns and suggests that the brain needs a learning procedure that can learn on the fly without stopping to perform backpropagation. The limitation of backpropagation is that it requires perfect knowledge of the forward pass computation in order to compute the correct derivatives, and reinforcement learning suffers from high variance. However, the forward-forward algorithm (FF) can be used to replace the forward and backward passes of backpropagation without needing to know the precise details of the forward computation. FF is comparable in speed to backpropagation and has the advantage of being able to learn while pipelining sequential data through a neural network without storing the neural activities or stopping to propagate error derivatives. The FF algorithm is somewhat slower than backpropagation and does not generalize quite as well on several of the toy problems investigated in the paper. Nevertheless, it may be superior to backpropagation as a model of learning in cortex and as a way of making use of very low-power analog hardware without resorting to reinforcement learning. The FF algorithm is a greedy multi-layer learning procedure that operates on real data and "negative data" with opposite objectives to increase or decrease the goodness in every hidden layer. The goodness function for a layer is the sum of the squares of the activities of the rectified linear neurons in that layer, and the aim of the learning is to correctly classify input vectors as positive or negative data. The paper discusses a new algorithm called ff that uses layer-wise goodness function to learn multiple layers of representation in neural networks. The algorithm is tested on the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits and achieves a 1.4% test error rate on the permutation-invariant version of the task, which is similar to the performance of backpropagation. The paper suggests that ff can work well in relatively small neural networks and further investigation is required to determine its effectiveness in larger networks. This section discusses using negative data in the form of hybrid images to answer questions about unsupervised learning with feature vectors. The authors use a contrastive learning method with corrupted versions of the data, and train a neural network with hidden layers to perform classification tasks. The architecture of the neural network is described, and the authors experiment with using fully connected layers versus local receptive fields. Peer normalization is also used to prevent over-activity in hidden units. The experiments show promising results for using hybrid images as negative data. The reading discusses using feed-forward neural networks (FFNN) for both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks. Unsupervised learning is effective for large models that need to perform various tasks because it can extract a wide range of features. However, for models interested in one specific task and have limitations on model capacity, supervised learning may be more suitable. One way to achieve this with FFNN is to include the label in the input. The reading also covers using FFNN for modeling top-down effects in perception by treating a static image as a video processed by a multi-layer recurrent neural network. It explains that a feed-forward neural network can be treated as a recurrent neural network by processing the static image as a video. Finally, experiments with the MNIST dataset have shown that the proposed approach works well in practice. Figure 2 shows the receptive fields of 100 neurons in the first hidden layer of a network trained on jittered MNIST dataset, where the class labels are represented in the first 10 pixels of each image. Figure 3 shows the recurrent network that was used to process video. The article discusses experiments with a neural network called FF (Feedforward). The network uses synchronous updates with pre-normalized states. The network was trained on a dataset called mnist and achieved a test error rate of 1.31%. The article also describes using predictions from the spatial context as a teaching signal for local feature extraction. The network was also tested on the cifar-10 dataset with good results when compared to backpropagation networks. Table 1 compares the test performance of backpropagation and feedforward (FF) learning methods on Cifar-10 using non-convolutional nets with local receptive fields of size 11x11 and 2 or 3 hidden layers. Both methods used weight-decay to reduce overfitting. While backpropagation reduces training error more quickly, FF has slightly worse test performance, but the gap between the two methods does not increase with more hidden layers. A single forward pass with FF is used to classify an image, but it is better to run the net with a particular label as the top-level input and record the average goodness over middle iterations, after which the label with the highest goodness is chosen. The paper discusses a learning approach called "ff" and proposes that positive data should be processed when awake and negative data should be generated by the network itself and processed during sleep. The efficacy of this approach is discussed in relation to a previous example of predicting the next character in a sequence. The paper also compares ff to boltzmann machines, which are a type of deep neural network that performs unsupervised contrastive learning. While the mathematical simplicity of boltzmann machines' learning rule is exciting, it is impractical as a machine learning technique and implausible as a model of cortical learning. The paper also discusses the importance of separating the positive and negative phases of learning and explores the potential effects of eliminating the negative phase updates for a period of time. The article discusses the concept of Boltzmann machine learning, which replaces the forward and backward passes of backpropagation with iterative settlings. The Boltzmann machine is a combination of two ideas: learning by minimizing the free energy on real data and using the Hopfield energy as the energy function. The article also discusses the relationship between Boltzmann machines and generative adversarial networks (GANs) and self-supervised contrastive methods for learning. Finally, the article introduces a new model called "ff" that uses contrastive learning and a simple, local goodness function to generate data without backpropagation. The article discusses different methods for optimizing objective functions in neural networks to extract representations of crops from images. Simclr-like methods use backpropagation and comparison of two different representation vectors, while ff uses multiple sources of information to measure agreement. However, both methods have weaknesses, such as a limited amount of constraints on representations and the need to divide inputs arbitrarily. Stacked contrastive learning is another method, but it has a flaw in that it can learn correlational structure that is not related to the external world. To address this, the original Boltzmann machine learning algorithm contrasted statistics caused by different external boundary conditions. This passage discusses the behavior of a neural network with full connectivity between layers and the possibility of performing simultaneous weight updates in many different layers. Additionally, it explores the potential for using black boxes with slow learning to improve the system over a longer timescale. The relevance of these findings to analog hardware is also discussed. The passage concludes with a brief description of the perceptron convergence procedure. The article discusses two main topics - the use of digital computations for multiplying two n-bit numbers and the concept of mortal computation. The use of two forward passes instead of a forward and a backward pass can make a-to-d converters unnecessary for computing gradients. The concept of mortal computation suggests that instead of the separation of software from hardware, we can allow large and unknown variations in the connectivity and non-linearities of different instances of hardware that are intended to perform the same task and then rely on a learning procedure to discover parameter values that make effective use of the unknown properties of each particular instance of the hardware, hence achieving huge savings in the energy required to perform a computation and the cost of fabricating the hardware. Lastly, the article discusses distillation as a way of transferring the internal representations of a teacher to a learner and how language can play a role in facilitating the learning of internal representation vectors by the members of a culture. This passage discusses the use of the forward-forward algorithm in hardware with unknown details, and its potential for scaling to large neural networks. It also highlights the benefits of sharing weights across large models to increase knowledge sharing bandwidth. The author also presents several open questions regarding the forward-forward algorithm, such as the best goodness function and activation function to use, the possibility of using local goodness functions for spatial data and using fast weights for sequential data.
