The article includes eight references related to deep learning methods for depth estimation from a single image, defocus deblurring, and lens and aperture camera models. Additionally, the section provides biographies of four authors involved in computer vision research with interests in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and image processing. Saqib Nazir is a Ph.D. student in the Meneloas-NT project working on acquiring depth from defocus images with deep learning. Lorenzo Vaquero is a Ph.D. student with an interest in visual object tracking and deep learning for autonomous vehicles. Victor M. Brea is an associate professor working on deep learning algorithms and efficient architectures for computer vision. Manuel Mucientes is an associate professor whose primary research focus is on artificial intelligence applied to computer vision for object detection and tracking, machine learning, and process mining. Finally, Daniela Coltuc has extensive experience in information theory with applications in image processing and computational imaging.
