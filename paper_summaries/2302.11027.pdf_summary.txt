The article discusses the development of deep learning models for real-time surveillance and crime prevention using CCTV cameras. These models use features such as edges, lines, and forms to detect abnormal behavior and track suspicious activity. Confusion matrices are used to evaluate the performance of the models in identifying violent and non-violent activities. The article emphasizes the importance of deploying these models on devices with higher processing power, such as Jetson Nano. The authors also suggest optimizing the models by introducing more samples of non-violent behavior. The article includes references to several previous studies that focus on anomaly detection and object recognition in surveillance videos using deep learning techniques.
