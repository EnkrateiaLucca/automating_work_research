Summary for page 0: The paper proposes a new approach called "successive prompting" for answering complex questions with limited supervision. It involves iteratively breaking down a complex task into simple tasks, solving them, and repeating the process until the final solution is obtained. This approach allows for multiple opportunities to query in-context examples at each reasoning step, learns question decomposition separately from question answering, and integrates bespoke components for reasoning steps where large language models do not perform well. The intermediate supervision is generated synthetically to bootstrap a model's ability to decompose and answer intermediate questions. The proposed model achieves an improvement of 5% absolute F1 on a few-shot version of the DROP dataset compared to a state-of-the-art model with the same supervision. ******* 
Summary for page 1: The article proposes a method called "successive prompting" for addressing complex questions with intermediate steps. The method involves iteratively breaking down a complex question into simpler questions, answering them one at a time, and then repeating the process until the complex question is answered. The decoupling of the supervision of each step allows for the use of targeted examples for each step, even when performing in-context learning, and synthetically injecting data to fill in gaps. The authors provide a few-shot variant of drop dataset to show the effectiveness of the method. They find that the approach outperforms state-of-the-art models by 5% on this dataset. ******* 
Summary for page 2: This text describes the use of successive prompting in answering a series of questions related to field goals in football. In each step, the previous answer is used as context to generate the next question, until a final answer is obtained. The text also discusses the training paradigm for using successive prompting with in-context learning and model fine-tuning. Examples are selected based on similarity to the test input from two indexes: one for question decomposition and one for question answering. ******* 
Summary for page 3: The article discusses a method for in-context learning to answer complex questions by breaking them down into simple questions. They use successive prompting and model fine-tuning using T5-based sequence-to-sequence models. The article also discusses the use of specialized modules for solving different QA tasks, such as arithmetic operations. To address data issues, the authors propose a way to synthetically generate complex questions and their decompositions using semi-structured data from tables in English Wikipedia. The generation process involves employing curated templates to convert the rows in the tables into paragraphs and synthesizing data for 10 simple operations. The article concludes by providing details on the generation process and dataset statistics. ******* 
Summary for page 4: The article discusses experiments conducted on the DROP dataset to test different reasoning compositions. The first experiment involved counting the number of opponents and using higher-order decompositions. The second experiment involved sorting and counting which venue had the most number of opponents. The third experiment involved comparison and counting the number of venues for different rounds. For these experiments, synthetic examples were used alongside annotated data from the DROP dataset. A modular approach was employed, using a symbolic calculator and language model, which had to be fine-tuned to improve performance. The best-performing model achieved an F1 score of 30.6%. ******* 
Summary for page 5: The article discusses a method of using synthetic data and prompting to improve performance on complex question answering tasks, specifically the DROP dataset. The method involves training a model to decompose complex questions into simpler question-answer pairs and using contrastive estimation to discourage the model from learning incorrect steps. The authors compare their method with several symbolic and non-symbolic baselines and find that their method outperforms the others, achieving a 5.4 increase in F1 score over the state-of-the-art model. The authors conclude that using synthetic data and prompting can help models adapt to new domains with little to no in-domain supervision. ******* 
Summary for page 6: The text discusses a study on a method called successive prompting for improving question answering performance. The study involved models that relied on symbolic compositions and models that were non-symbolic. The models were tested on answering questions from the DROP dataset. The study found that symbolic models performed better in the absence of decompositions, but non-symbolic models performed better with synthetic data and decompositions. The study also compared in-context learning and fine-tuning and found that fine-tuning resulted in higher performance. The study included qualitative examples to illustrate the strengths and limitations of the successive prompting method. ******* 
Summary for page 7: The text includes examples of successive prompting, where a series of questions are asked to arrive at an answer. The questions are fine-tuned based on the context of the problem. The generated decompositions show the strengths and weaknesses of successive prompting. The examples include questions about the longest touchdown pass, which quarters Stephen Gostkowski kicked field goals in, the number of field goals kicked in the first half, the number of personnel who were not civil servants, and which port Korean immigrants departed from first. ******* 
Summary for page 8: The article discusses the challenges of decomposing complex questions, particularly when implicit reasoning is involved. The authors propose a method to successively decompose complex questions into simple QA pairs, allowing for modular QD and QA systems that can be trained and queried independently. They demonstrate the effectiveness of their method through experiments and comparison with related works. However, their method has limitations, such as not being able to handle all types of complex questions and not being able to perform deeper reasoning. They acknowledge the support of various organizations and individuals in their work. *******

It notes that the method has limitations, such as the need for decomposition data and difficulty in choosing the right granularity for decomposition, as well as increasing computational requirements. The article does not address social impacts or biases in natural language processing systems. It includes references to other works in the field of natural language processing. *******

Summary for page 12: The given data shows the attendance and details of matches played by a team in various rounds against different opponents at different venues on specific dates. The data can be used to answer various questions related to opponents, attendance, dates, and rounds. Different types of questions that can be asked include filter, count, comparison, difference, sum, and sort. Answering these questions requires decomposing them into smaller sub-questions and performing appropriate operations on the data. Overall, the data is useful for analyzing the team's performance and attendance for the given matches. *******

The instructions involve sorting and filtering the attendance data, finding the differences and sums of attendance values, and counting the number of occurrences of certain criteria. The examples use a wikitables dataset as a reference. *******
